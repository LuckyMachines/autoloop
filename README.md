# Hardhat Starter Project

This is a template to quickly spin up a hardhat project with some standard packages. The sample contract / test / deploy files are left here for reference, but should be deleted from any production project.

Select `Use this template` to create a new repo from this template.

Once your new project is created, clone it with GitHub CLI:
```shell
gh repo clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO
```

To start run:

```shell
yarn
```

Some typical hardhat commands:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
